  <p>Sometimes when you are visiting a website on your phone </br> the scale of the design and content seems to be out of proportion. </br> Seem familiar? That is because the developer has not adjusted </br> the scale and elements of the website to fit all usersâ€™ devices. </br> Responsive design is when the appearance of a website or application </br> changes depending on the screen size and orientation of the device </br> being used to view it. It is important for developers to consider content, </br> design and performance to work for all common devices </br> <strong>so that it does not affect the user experience. </strong> </p>
